# SDGoals
 
This is a small project I will work on from time to time. My undergraduate was focused on International Development and Humanitarian Assistance, and the SDGs were a core part of much of my coursework. Now that I my work is largely detached from my undergraduate education, I enjoy keeping that spirit alive and this is just one candle for the flame.
